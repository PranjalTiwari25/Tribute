            <h2>Great Indian Physicist</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman</b> was born in Tiruchirappalli in the Madras Presidency of British India (now Tiruchirapalli, Tamil Nadu, India) to Iyer Brahmin parents,Chandrasekhar Ramanathan Iyer and Parvathi Ammal.He was the second of eight siblings.His father was a teacher at a local high school, and earned a modest income. He recalled: "I was born with a copper spoon in my mouth. At my birth my father was earning the magnificent salary of ten rupees per month!"In 1892, his family moved to Visakhapatnam (then Vizagapatam or Vizag) in Andhra Pradesh as his father was appointed to the faculty of physics at Mrs A.V. Narasimha Rao College.

                Raman was educated at the St Aloysius' Anglo-Indian High School, Visakhapatnam.He passed matriculation at age 11 and the First Examination in Arts examination (equivalent to today's intermediate examination, pre-university course) with a scholarship at age 13,securing first position in both under the Andhra Pradesh school board (now Andhra Pradesh Board of Secondary Education) examination.
                
                In 1902, Raman joined Presidency College in Madras (now Chennai) where his father had been transferred to teach mathematics and physics.In 1904, he obtained a B.A. degree from the University of Madras, where he stood first and won the gold medals in physics and English.At age 18, while still a graduate student, he published his first scientific paper on "Unsymmetrical diffraction bands due to a rectangular aperture" in the British journal Philosophical Magazine in 1906.He earned an M.A. degree from the same university with highest distinction in 1907.His second paper published in the same journal that year was on surface tension of liquids.It was alongside Lord Rayleigh's paper on the sensitivity of ear to sound,and from which Lord Rayleigh started to communicate with Raman, courteously addressing him as Professor.
                
                Aware of Raman's capacity, his physics teacher Rhishard Llewellyn Jones insisted he continue research in England. Jones arranged for Raman's physical inspection with Colonel (Sir Gerald) Giffard.Raman often had poor health and was considered as a "weakling".The inspection revealed that he would not withstand the harsh weathers of England,the incident of which he later recalled, and said, "[Giffard] examined me and certified that I was going to die of tuberculosisâ€¦ if I were to go to England.
